# 1. Introduction 

As students, we know how commuting to school can be very tiresome and challenging. Travelling to school becomes even more difficult when you live further away from school than others. Our study aims to comprehend how students' conditions, e.g., how far their house is from school, influences their grades. Our project analyzes whether factors such as absences and travel time to school are connected to their performance in final exams.
Finding the data was essential as it would give us more insights and help us address the question. We acquired our dataset from Kaggle. It surveyed students' math and Portuguese language courses in two secondary schools. The data contained the final math and Portuguese grades, but we used their final math grade as the outcome variable. The numerical variable was absences, and our categorical variable in our project was the travel time, with four levels, "1"( < 15 mins), "2"(15~30 mins), "3"(30 mins ~ 1 hour) and "4"(> 1 hour). 
Shown below is a preview of 5 randomly chosen rows of the data set we will use:


```{r}
distance %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

# 2. Exploratory data analysis

In our dataset, we had a sample size of 395 students(Table 1), and we were fortunate not to find any missing values. The mean of the travel time was greatest for students who spent less than 15 minutes going to school (n = 257,  $\bar{x}$ = 10.8, sd = 4.52), intermediate for those who spent around 15-30 minutes going to school (n = 107,  $\bar{x}$ = 9.91, sd = 4.60) and students who spent 30 minutes to an hour travelling to school(n = 23,  $\bar{x}$ = 9.26, sd = 5.07). Lastly, it was lowest for students who spent more than 1 hour commuting to school (n = 8,  $\bar{x}$ = 8.75, sd = 3.92). The average number of absences for students was 5.71(sd =8.00).

```{r include = F}
distance %>% 
  summarize(min = min(absences), 
            max = max(absences), 
            mean = mean(absences), 
            sd = sd(absences))
```

Table 1. Summary statistics of final Math grades for students travel less than 15 mins, 15 to 30 mins, 30 mins to 1 hour, more than 1 hour to school.

```{r}
distance %>% 
  group_by(traveltime) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            mean = mean(final_math_grade, na.rm = T), 
            median = median(final_math_grade, na.rm = T), 
            sd = sd(final_math_grade, na.rm = T), 
            min = min(final_math_grade, na.rm = T), 
            max = max(final_math_grade, na.rm = T))
```

Looking at the distribution of the Final math grade in Figure 1, although there is an outlier of grade 0, which might suggest the right skewness, the data appears symmetrical/bell-shaped; hence we did not apply any transformations.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Historgram of Math Grades", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(distance, aes(x = final_math_grade)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, color = "white", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Final Math Grade", y = "Number of Students with the Grade") 
```

In Figure 2, we developed a scatterplot to see the overall relationship between the number of school absences and the final math grade, and we observed a relationship between them. Although, it is a very weak positive correlation with a (slightly) positive line of best fit. Initially, we assumed there would be no relationship as the points on the scatter plot seem to be scattered randomly on the left side of the plot. Likewise, there's weak to little association between these two variables.

```{r include = F}
distance %>%  
  summarize(cor(final_math_grade, absences))
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. School Absences compared to Math Grades", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(distance, aes(x = absences, y = final_math_grade ))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE ) +
  labs(y = "Final Math Grade", 
       x = "Number of School Absences")
```

As shown in figure 3, the Final math grade was the highest in the group of students with the lowest travel time and the lowest within the group with the highest travel time. Most box plots had an outlier(Grade 0), but the box plot students with the highest travel time had more outliers.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Boxplot of Travel Time compared to Math Grade", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(distance, aes(x = traveltime, y = final_math_grade, fill = traveltime)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Final Math Grade", x = "Home to School Travel Time")
```

As for the coloured scatter plot, we could see the differences in correlations between the categories, allowing the viewer to visualize the differences in sample sizes better. Despite low correlation values, all lines appear positive, implying a positive relationship. There seems to be some interaction between the categories, and all four categories vary slightly in their slopes.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Colored Scatterplot of Math Grades compared to Absences", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(distance, aes(x = absences, y = final_math_grade, color = traveltime))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE ) +
  labs(y = "Final Math Grade", x = "Number of School Absences")
```

# 3. Multiple linear regression

## 3.1 Methods

The components of our multiple linear regression model are the following:

* Outcome variable $y$ = Final Math grade
* Numerical explanatory variable $x_1$ = Times of absences
* Categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ = Travel time from home to school

where the unit of analysis is high school, given that each row in our dataset corresponds to a unique high school. As discussed earlier, we did not include an interaction effect because the slopes appear to be reasonably parallel in Figure 4. 


## 3.2 Model Results

```{r}
math_model <- lm(final_math_grade ~ absences + traveltime, data = distance)

```

## 3.3 Interpreting the regression table

The regression equation for Math SAT score is the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}\widehat {score} =& b_{0} + b_{prct} \cdot prct + b_{15 to 30 mins} \cdot 1_{is\ 15 to 30 mins}(x_2) + b_{30 to 1 hour} \cdot 1_{is\ 30 to 1 hour}(x_2) + b_{> 1 hour} \cdot 1_{is\ > 1 hour}(x_2)\\ 
 =& 10.674 + 0.019 \cdot prct - 0.882 \cdot 1_{is\ 15 to 30 mins }(x_2) - 1.508 \cdot 1_{is\ 30 mins to 1 hour}(x_2) - 2.010 \cdot 1_{is\ > 1 hour}(x_2)
\end{aligned} 

$$

The intercept ($b_0$ = 10.674) represents the final math grade when the students are said to be absent and the travel time is less than 15 minutes (Table 2).
* The estimate for the slope for absences($b_{prct}$ = 0.019) is the associated change in the final math grade depending on the number of students. Based on this estimate, there was an associated increase in the final math grade of, on average,  0.019 points for every increase in a student's absences.
* The estimate for travel time: 15~30 mins ($b_{15to30mins}$ = -0.882) , 30 mins ~ 1 hour ($b_{30to1hour}$ = -1.508) and  > 1 hour($b_{>1hour}$ = -2.010)are the offsets in intercept relative to the baseline group's, less than 15 minutes, intercept (Table 2). In other words, students who take around 15-30 minutes of travel time scored -0.882 lower than those who spend less than 15 minutes. Likewise,  students who spent 30 minutes to an hour of travel time scored on average -1.508 and those who spent more than an hour commuting scored on average -2.010 lower.

Thus the four regression lines have equations:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\text{< 15 mins  (in red)}: \widehat {score} =& 10.674 + 0.019 \cdot prct\\
\text{15 ~ 30 mins (in green)}: \widehat {score} =& 9.792 + 0.019 \cdot prct\\
\text{30mins ~ 1 hour (in blue)}: \widehat {score} =& 9.166 + 0.019 \cdot prct\\
\text{> 1 hour (in purple)}: \ widehat [score] =& 8.664 + 0.019 \cdot prct
\end{aligned} 

$$
