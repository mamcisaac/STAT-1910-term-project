# Instructions {-}

Everything in this course builds up to the term-long group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline in as
faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices.*

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("static/images/data_science_pipeline.png")
```

In order to break down the task and minimize end-of-semester stress, you'll be working on the project in five phases:

1. [**Project groups:**](#groups) Form groups.
1. [**Project data:**](#data) Propose a data set for your project. `r hint_1`. After you submit your data proposal, you will get feedback that you should incorporate in your project proposal.
1. [**Project proposal:**](#proposal) Ensure you can work with your data in R by performing an exploratory data analysis. `r hint_2` After you submit your project proposal, you will get  feedback that you should incorporate in your initial project submission. 
1. [**Initial project submission:**](#submission) Make an initial submission of your project. You will skip some of the sections for now and only complete them after we have covered inference for regression in class. After you submit your work, you will get feedback that you should incorporate in your final report. 
1. [**Final project submission:**](#resubmission) Incorporate your feedback from the initial project submission phase, complete the remaining sections, and resubmit your project. The majority of your grade will come from this final project submission.

During each Project Phase, each student should take on a specific role within the group:

* Facilitator -- Keeps group on task and verifies that all contribute. Makes the submission on behalf of the group. 
* Recorder -- Takes notes on important thoughts expressed in the group. 
* Reporter -- Leads the actual writing of the report.
* Time Keeper -- Monitors time and planning. Monitors if the project is on track. Ensures the work is submitted on time.
* Checker -- Checks for accuracy and clarity of thinking during discussions. Checks written work and tracks points. Ensures the work is submitted on time.

You should take on a different role for each Project Phase.

With each submission, your group will need to report which student completed each role, and your group will report on how much each student contributed. If a particular student contributes less, then they will receive fewer marks. If some group members contribute more, then their grades will be increased correspondingly.

# Project Groups {#groups}

For this Project Phase Submission, you must select a group. You will work with this group throughout the course to complete the Term Project. 

To accomplish this, you must use the "Select Project Groups" group self-selection activity on our Moodle page

* Groups should have 5 members each. 
* You should form groups with students from your own course Section (sometimes class time will be dedicated to group work).
* Students who do not join a group by the deadline will be placed in groups together, so that more engaged students are less likely to be saddled with group members who cannot meet deadlines.
* All groups members are expected to contribute and your grade will be depend on your group's assessment of your individual contributions.
* If you are looking for a group to join, use the "Search for Teammates!" post on Piazza.

# Project Data {#data} 

For the Project Data Submission, you must find and summarize the data that your group plans to use for the remainder of the Term Project.

**`r hint_1`**


You can get a sense for the requirements of this project phase by reading some example data proposals `r submission_will_differ`:

* [Example project data submission 1](static/term_project/data_example.html){target="_blank"}
* [Example project data submission 2](static/term_project/data_example_01.html){target="_blank"}
* [Example project data submission 3](static/term_project/data_example_02.html){target="_blank"}


## What to submit

You must download the following <a href="static/term_project/data.Rmd" download>`data.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file and complete it for your chosen data set.

`r only_group_leader`

1. The completed `data.Rmd` R Markdown file
1. The corresponding `data.html` HTML report file
1. If your data is not confidential or sensitive in nature, then publish your data as a CSV file on Google Sheets --  you can do this by following the 6 steps in [this Twitter thread](https://t.co/CeM3IIemFU) (or see [this screenshot of the thread](static/images/Uploading_csv.png)). That way your group can all access a single copy of your data on the web. If your data is confidential or sensitive in nature, do not publish it on the web, but rather submit the Excel or CSV file as well.




## Data Requirements

Find a data set that fits the following specifications. Note your data may need a little wrangling from its original form.

### Specifications {-}

Your data must contain

1. (If available) An [identification variable](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#identification-vs-measurement-variables){target="_blank"} that uniquely identifies each observation in each row. 
1. A numerical outcome variable $y$. Note: binary outcomes variables with 0/1 values are not technically numerical.
1. Two explanatory variables:
    + A numerical explanatory variable $x_1$. Note: this can be some notion of time.
    + A categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ that has between 3-5 levels. Note: If your data has more than 5 levels, they can be collapsed into 5 using data wrangling later.
1. At least 50 observations/rows.

### Possible sources {-}

Here are some possible data sources:

* Best option: data from your own research or other courses! The more connected you feel with your data, the more motivated you will be for this project.
* Next best options: Online data repositories such as (but not limited to):

## Hints

* **Where is this heading?**: For the next project phase (project proposal), you will be making a visualization like this [one](static/term_project/proposal_example.html#colored-scatterplot){target="_blank"}. If you can make a visualization like this one, then your data is set for the rest of the project.
* When you have questions:
    * Please ask questions that you think the entire class would like to know the answer to in the `project` folder on Piazza; if necessary, you can make the post private. 
* Only minimal data wrangling using the `dplyr` package is expected at this time; you will be doing more for the "project proposal" phase coming up. That being said, feel free to experiment!


* Disclaimer: Just because things seem good now doesn't mean your project data is set for semester. Unforeseen problems may crop up during the next phase on data wrangling, at which point you may need to revise your data. This is a reality of data collection in the real world!
* Do not include any `View()` statements in your `.Rmd` files as this may cause an error.
* Avoid "data dumps". For example, showing the contents of all 1000 rows in a data frame. This will make your output document really large and unreadable.

# Project Proposal {#proposal}

For the Project Proposal Submission, you must dig a little deeper into your chosen data and propose a more concrete plan for the remainder of the Term Project.


**`r hint_2`**

You can get a sense for the requirements of this project phase by reading some example project proposals `r submission_will_differ`:

* [Example project propsal submission 1](static/term_project/proposal_example.html){target="_blank"}

1. Only if your data is confidential or sensitive in nature, submit your Excel or CSV file as well. Otherwise you should publish your data as a CSV file on Google Sheets as described above.






## Hints

Your data may require some wrangling to get it in the appropriate format. Given that this is not a class where data wrangling is a central focus, we suggest you check out the following resources:

1. The SMCS help center. 
1. Be sure to look at the [data wrangling "Tips & Tricks"](https://moderndive.com/C-appendixC.html#data-wrangling){target="_blank"} ModernDive page written by Jenny Smetzer. It's based on the seven most common data wrangling questions they've encountered from students while they were working on their term projects:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("static/images/data_wrangling.png")
```

3. Post your question in Piazza.

# Peer Evaluations

Remember that you will all be held accountable for your individual contributions to the group project; you will submit your project as a group, but you will receive an individual grade based on your contributions as well as the quality of your group's work.
